1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. Before you leave for the day, do this and he will review it.
    - I always put a uuid in the request body or the url and the authorization header is new to me.
    - I'm a little unsure on namespaces, scoping in c# compared to other languages. This is a weak spot for me
    - does MVC being old apply to other frameworks like django or spring?
    

2. Every morning after today we will start with me asking a random selection of you this question:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yeserday?
    - What was cool and you want to know more about?
