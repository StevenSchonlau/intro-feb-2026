# 2026-02-10

1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. Before you leave for the day, do this and he will review it.
- Its just difficult to "make" myself think in the way of TDD, I just jump straight into implementation
- Also I think I don't have the intuition for code smelling yet, I can see how nested and complex stuff is bad, but I struggle to abstract it properly.

2. Every morning after today we will start with me asking a random selection of you this question:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yeserday?
    - What was cool and you want to know more about?
