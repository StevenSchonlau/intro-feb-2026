1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. Before you leave for the day, do this and he will review it.

    I'm not sure about the naming system with the numbers. It seems like a lot to remember and too much work to maintain, long file names. Any other systems for organizing with more streamline?

2. Every morning after today we will start with me asking a random selection of you this question:
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yeserday?
    - What was cool and you want to know more about?

    The keyboard shortcuts were very helpful, and the code documentation foam plugin was cool, especially the placeholders.
